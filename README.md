# Lung Cancer Prediction Project

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of lung cancer based on various features such as lifestyle, medical history, and symptoms. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to assist in the early diagnosis of lung cancer, potentially saving lives and improving patient outcomes.

## Problem Statement
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment. The primary objective of this project is to predict whether a person has lung cancer based on a given dataset of features. The predictive model can help raise awareness and encourage timely medical consultations for those at higher risk.

## Features of the Project
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzing the dataset for trends, distributions, and relationships between attributes.
   - Addressing data quality issues, if any.

2. **Model Development and Comparison**:
   - Training multiple machine learning models on the dataset.
   - Comparing model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
   - Recommend the best model for production use.

### Running the Project
Currently, this project is just for viewing for insights.

## Results
- Insights on key attributes contributing to lung cancer risk.
- A predictive model with performance metrics highlighting its effectiveness.

## Contribution
We welcome contributions to improve the project. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
